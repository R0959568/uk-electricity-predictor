CONCLUSIONS: ELECTRICITY DEMAND PREDICTION MODEL COMPARISON
================================================================================

1. OVERALL BEST MODEL:
   Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance with:
   - MAE:  4411.09 MW
   - RMSE: 5127.38 MW
   - R²:   0.5538
   - Training Environment: Local

2. MODEL PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS:
   - Baseline (Linear Regression) provides reasonable performance for simple deployment
   - Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) show significant improvements
   - AutoML models (PyCaret) efficiently identified strong candidates
   - AWS-trained models demonstrate cloud scalability

3. TRAINING ENVIRONMENT COMPARISON:
   Local Training:
   - Pros: Lower cost, faster iteration, full control
   - Cons: Limited by local compute resources

   AWS SageMaker:
   - Pros: Scalable, managed infrastructure, production-ready
   - Cons: Higher cost, network latency for data transfer

4. RECOMMENDATIONS:

   For Production Deployment:
   - Use Gradient Boosting for best accuracy
   - Consider ensemble of top 2-3 models for robustness
   - Monitor model drift with UK electricity demand patterns

   For Development/Prototyping:
   - Use Linear Regression baseline for quick validation
   - Leverage PyCaret AutoML for rapid experimentation

   For Scalability:
   - Deploy on AWS SageMaker for high-volume predictions
   - Set up automated retraining pipelines
   - Implement A/B testing between models

5. FEATURE IMPORTANCE:
   - Temporal features (hour, day_of_week, month) are most important
   - Cyclical encodings (sin/cos) capture periodicity effectively
   - Historical demand patterns strongly influence predictions

6. NEXT STEPS:
   - Implement real-time prediction API
   - Set up model monitoring and alerting
   - Collect production metrics for model evaluation
   - Plan quarterly model retraining schedule
   - Consider additional external features (weather, holidays, events)
